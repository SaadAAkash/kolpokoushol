Have you applied to KolpoKoushol yet?

**If not, what are you waiting for?**

KolpoKoushol began in 2015 to promote the philosophy of MIT Media Lab in Bangladesh. MIT Media Lab is one of the most innovative research labs in the world, located at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA. Our founder, Nazmus Saquib, received his PhD from this lab.

## But what's in it for you?

KolpoKoushol provides a way for Bangladeshi students and professionals to experience the Media Lab way for creativity and innovation. In addition, in KolpoKoushol 2023, selected workshop demo builders will have the opportunity to pitch to Silicon Valley VCs and founders after the workshop, and interview for some relevant California Bay Area startups for job positions. 

Selected demos that were built during the workshop will also be considered for crowdfunding campaigns on Kickstarter and/or other crowdfunding sites, providing the opportunity and capital to build startups from the demos!

If all of that sounds cool to you, don't miss this rare opportunity to showcase to the world the most promising ideas that you and KolpoKoushol will brainstorm and build together!
